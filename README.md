# Summary

A github repository for my work during the fifth-term elective class at my school regarding Rocket Design and Flight simulation in Kerbal Space Program.

All assignments from [https://rdsf-ave.github.io/index.html](https://rdsf-ave.github.io/index.html)

For personal reference, tutorials can be found here: [https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorials](https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/)

#### [Milestone Missions in KSP:](https://rdsf-ave.github.io/milestones.html)

- [X] Launch-and-Land: Successfully launch a manned rocket, land it safely, and recover the totally fine pilot.

- [X] Orbit: Build a manned rocket, launch it into a orbit and complete at least one full orbit. Then re-enter the atmosphere and safely land back on the surface.

- [X] Mun Landing: Create a rocket that will transport a pilot safely to the Mun, the closest moon around Kerbin. Plant a flag on the Mun, and then return back to Kerbin using your rocket.

- [X] Duna Rover: Create a rover that can drive around on the surface of a planet and then design an unmanned rocket to fly it to Duna, the version of Mars in the Kerbol system. Safely land the rocket on the planet, deploy the rover, and then drive it around on Duna.

#### [Space Race Missions (Optional + Milestone)](https://rdsf-ave.github.io/SpaceRace.html)

Space Race Missions are optional, but can help with milestone missions.
